Dynamic Texture Generator (Starling framework Extension)
This tool will convert any MovieClip containing Other MovieClips, Sprites or Graphics into a starling Texture Atlas, all in runtime. By using it, you won't have to statically create your spritesheets. Just take a regular MovieClip containing all the display objects you wish to put into your Altas, and convert everything from vectors to bitmap textures. This extension could save you a lot of time specially if you'll be coding mobile apps with the starling framework.

Steps:
Create a new fla and make sure it is minimum flash 9 using as3.
Start creating movieclips that you want to be written to a sprite sheet. Be sure to avoid using actionscript, and if you have sub clips use graphics as opposed to movieclips so that they get picked up.
Drag all the movieclips you want rendered to the main stage and name them.
Export the swf and load it into the tool.
Modify the size of the sprite sheet to fit your needs. Power of 2 textures are recommended:1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, etc..
Save the file. You will now have a zip containing your image a piece of xml and a piece of json you can use for your project.
